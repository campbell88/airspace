## Tools I Used 
- VS Code
- Create React App
- Google Maps API
- google-maps-react npm package
- Firebase hosting

## Current State
The app shows a map with the polygon of the controlled airspace coordinates. It has a polyline that is clickable and draggable. I had trouble adding functionality to the polyline that is suppose to represent potential flight routes. My plan was to have the polyline, when dragged over the controlled airspace, to show an alert that says you cannot fly there, with some funny text/image to win you over. But alas, I have failed. Also had some issues deploying to Github Pages, so I opted for Firebase instead.

## Key Takeaways
- I enjoyed the challenge
- React is not my forte
- Thanks for taking the time to view my code
